# HHA-504-Assignment_Cloudcosts-

This first screenshot shows the homescreen/entry page of Microsoft Azure along with all the different services and resources provided.

After clicking cost management (which was located on the bottom right of the first picture, we are then brought into the overview screen of Microsoft Azure's Cost Management tab.

If we were to look on the left side of the screen, we will be able to see different drop down menus for each respective tab. We will be taking a look at the Monitoring drop down menu and focusing on cost alerts, alert rules, and budgets.

Switching tabs, we are going to be taking a look at Google Cloud console to see how their cloud costs/budgeting compares to Azure. We will be using their "Billing" section under Quick Access.

After clicking Billing, we are brought to Google Cloud's overview of their billing section. As of today, I have used none of my applicable credits. Thus, the cost is at zero as showed by the photo.

Under the Cost Management tab, we can see that there are generated reports wo show the total cost a member incurs along with their forecasted total cost (based off previous historical data from the member).

Switching tabs once again, we will go back to Microsoft Azure to begin making a hypothetical budget. In this sceario, we will be making a hypothetical monthly budget where the threshold would be $8.00.

We will then add specific alert conditions that will essentially set off any alerts to the members. In this particular example, an alert will be made if 80% of the actual budge (which would be $6.4) is used. If this were to occur, the member will be promptly notified via email.

Once conditions are set, you can see the hypothetical budget is now made and ready to be put to use.

In Google Cloud Console, we will be using the "Budgets and Alerts" tab under Cost Management in order to create our budget through this specific service.

Through Google Cloud, we will be essentially doing the same thing as we did in Azure. We will be creating a monthly hypothetical budget of $8.00. This budget will be applicable to all folders/organizations, their projects, along with the services provided. 

<img width="1434" alt="11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75e48e7d-dee1-4220-ba0c-bc4e21856b6f">


As stated before, the budget will be a specified amount -- which is shown to be of $8.00.

An interesting feature that is given by Google Cloud, is that your are able to add multiple different threshold rules that will then cause different triggers or alerts to be sent to the member via email. It is worth mentioning that this feature is available in Microsoft Azure as well. However, depending on how much of the budget is used, the member can edit the type of trigger it sets off.

Once all the actions and triggers are made, we are able to finalize our budget.

In this image, we are able to see how Google Cloud is a bit more expansive with their features in terms of what they offer to help the user/member with their cloud storage costs. Members can make these budgets and choose which projects/organizations can be applied to. In addition,Google Cloud Console provides further details and ways to optimize cloud spending. For example, one of the services provided by Google Cloud Console is FinOps Hub with carbon tracking. It's particular, unique feature is to help with cost optimization. Although both services have their own types of budgets and alerts, GCC seems to go into further depth of how cost prevention and savings when it comes to handling cloud storage.
